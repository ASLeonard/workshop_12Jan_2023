# 1) Intro

We are going to learn how to study structural variants (SV) in cattle
genomes using long reads from Pacbio and Oxford Nanopore.  We are
going to discover and phase small variants and SVs using state of the
art tools. After that, we are going to calculate population allele
frequencies using a novel population genotyper tool (The Great
Genotyper).  Lastly, we are going to functionally annotate the
variants to facilitate studying the functional impact of the SVs.

## Aims

1. learn how to call and phase SVs using the different SV callers
2. compare the performance of different methods
3. learn how to calculate population allele frequency for cattle SVs
4. learn how to predict the impact of SV on genes

# 2) Significance 

* Novel way of calculating Population AF without needing databases like genomAD.
* Variants will be richly annotated with AF and predicted functional impact making it perfect for studying functional impact of the SVs.
* Workflow is benchmarked on cattle data and achieving accuracy of ~ 90%.
* Workflow is implemented using snakemake to make it simpler to run it afterward with your data and tweak it as you want.

# 3) Terminology

* Structural Variant: Genome variation of more than 50bp, it can be insertion, deletion, inversion, duplication, or translocation.
* haplotype-resolved assembly: Haplotype-resolved assembly is a method of generating a high-quality genome assembly that distinguishes between the two copies of each chromosome that an individual inherited, one from each parent. In other words, it allows researchers to separate and distinguish the unique DNA sequences inherited from an individual's mother and father. 
* Phased variant
* Population Allele frequency
* Snakemake
* Variant calling
* genotyping
* Population genotyping 


# 4) Data Description 

We chose sequencing datasets from the haplotype-resolved assembly
project (PRJEB42335) of Nellore and Brown_Swiss cross for two reasons:

1. We can create a gold standard benchmark by calling the variants
   from the haplotype-resolved assemblies which is considered to be
   the most accurate method (Figure 1).

2. The sample was heavily sequenced using Illumina, Pacbio(HIFI), and Oxford
   Nanopore which allows us to compare the results of different methods.

Test input data for the workshop is available on farm at:
```
/home/mshokrof/workshop_12Jan_2023_data/
```

The following table describes the test input file:

| file        |  Description  |
|:-------------:|:-------------|
| ARS-UCD1.2_Btau5.0.1Y.25.fa | Chromosome 25 from ARS-UCD1.2 genome|
| ARS-UCD1.2_Btau5.0.1Y.25.rmsk.bed.gz | Repeats annotation of chromosome 25|
| ARS-UCD1.2_Btau5.0.1Y.25.gff.gz | genes annotation of chromosome 25|
| goldstandard/callset_filered.25.vcf.gz | gold standard for variant calling created using the haployte resolved assemblies|
| goldstandard/callset_filered.25.bed.gz | the gold standard in bed format for plotting|
| ERR5043144.chr25.fastq.gz | Hifi reads from sample SAMEA10017982 that maps to chromsome 25|
| ERR7091271.chr25.fastq.gz | ONT reads from sample SAMEA10017982 that maps to chromsome 25|
| cattle_taurus_10 |  Folder contains Kmer indexes of 10  taurus samples|
| vep/ | vep annotation data|

We created a downsampled the data for the sake of this workshop. We
are going to focus on chromsome 25 only, and we are going to calculate
the AF in 30 samples (but we can scale to 4000 samples).

# 5) Let's start configurations

Log into 'farm.cse.ucdavis.edu' using the username and password you
were sent in an e-mail.

Then, run a bash session on a compute node like so:

```
srun  -p high2 -t 6:00:00 -c 8  --mem=30G --pty bash
```

This step creates a bash session and allocates 8 cores and 30GB RAM for it. 

## 5.1 Installing the environment

1. Clone this repository into your account.

```
cd ~/
git clone https://github.com/dib-lab/workshop_12Jan_2023.git
cd workshop_12Jan_2023/SV_calling_LR/
``` 

2. Install conda, create the conda environment, and install the tools

(If you are attending the PAG 2023 workshop, this step has already
been done for you - it takes about 10 minutes.  You will need to do
this step on your own cluster or machine, however.)

First, install conda, either from [here](https://conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/user-guide/install/index.html) or [here](https://github.com/conda-forge/miniforge).

Then, install mamba and create an environment with all the tools:

```
conda install mamba -y -n base -c conda-forge
mamba env create -f envs.yaml
conda activate cattle_sv
```

3. Activate the conda environment.

This makes all of the software accessible to you.

```
conda activate cattle_sv
```


4. Make sure that you can access the input files

```
ls -lh /home/mshokrof/workshop_12Jan_2023_data/ARS-UCD1.2_Btau5.0.1Y.25.fa
```

**Note:** If you are disconnected and log back in, you will need to run
the following two commands:

```
cd workshop_12Jan_2023/SV_calling_LR/
conda activate cattle_sv
```
in order to pick up where you left off!

## 5.2 View config.yaml

The workflow expects the list of input samples to be stored in
`samples_table.csv` and `subsample_table.csv`; the overall configuration
is in `config.yaml`.

You can examine `config.yaml` by typing:
```
cat config.yaml
```

We don't need to change anything for this workshop.

## 5.3 Configure samples with `sample_table.csv`

We should fill `sample_table.csv` with the metadata about our
datasets. It is in csv format where each row represents a dataset. For
each dataset, we add three comma separated columns:

1. sample_name: id for each dataset
2. sample_type: we define here the type for the datasets using the following types

    | Type        | Defention             |
    | ------------- |:-------------:|
    | ref      | reference genome |
    | gff      | genes annotation of the reference  |
    | rmsk     | repeat annotation of the reference |
    | gold     | gold standard for Variant calling  |
    | ont      | Oxford Nanopore sample |
    | hifi     | Pacbio Hifi sample|
    | clr      | Pacbio CLR sample|

3. bioSample: the biosample id of each dataset. 

For this workshop, we're going to use 8 datasets: reference genome,
repeat annotation, gene annotation, gold standard vcf format, gold
standard bed format, ont sample, hifi sample, and a cohort graph.

We've preconfigured them for you in `sample_table.csv.example` and
`subsample_table.csv.example`, and you
can copy them into place like so:
```
cp sample_table.csv.example sample_table.csv
cp subsample_table.csv.example subsample_table.csv
```

Next, run
```
cat sample_table.csv
```
to look at the contents; you should see:

>sample_name,sample_type,BioSample
>ucd1.2,ref,SAMN03145444
>ucd1.2_gff,gff,SAMN03145444
>ucd1.2_rmsk,rmsk,SAMN03145444
>NxB,gold,SAMEA7765441
>ERR5043144,hifi,SAMEA7765441
>ERR7091271,ont,SAMEA7765441
>cattle_taurus_10,graph,COHORT

The sample_type selects the workflow to execute - for example,
incorrectly specifying ERR5043144 as hifi will change the mapping tool
to pbmm2 and will call SVs with cuteSV.


## 5.4 Configure subsamples with ` subsample_table.csv`

Next, let's look at `subsample_table.csv`:
```
cat subsample_table.csv
```

You should see:

>sample_name,sample_type,BioSample
>ucd1.2,/home/mshokrof/workshop_12Jan_2023_data/ARS-UCD1.2_Btau5.0.1Y.25.fa
>ucd1.2_rmsk,/home/mshokrof/workshop_12Jan_2023_data/ARS-UCD1.2_Btau5.0.1Y.25.rmsk.bed.gz
>ucd1.2_gff,/home/mshokrof/workshop_12Jan_2023_data/ARS-UCD1.2_Btau5.0.1Y.25.gff.gz
>NxB,/home/mshokrof/workshop_12Jan_2023_data/goldstandard/callset_filered.25.bed.gz
>NxB,/home/mshokrof/workshop_12Jan_2023_data/goldstandard/callset_filered.25.vcf.gz
>ERR5043144,/home/mshokrof/workshop_12Jan_2023_data/ERR5043144.chr25.fastq.gz
>ERR7091271,/home/mshokrof/workshop_12Jan_2023_data/ERR7091271.chr25.fastq.gz
>cattle_taurus_10,/home/mshokrof/workshop_12Jan_2023_data/cohortGraphs/taurus_10/graph.dbg
>cattle_taurus_10,/home/mshokrof/workshop_12Jan_2023_data/cohortGraphs/taurus_10/graph.desc.tsv
>cattle_taurus_10,/home/mshokrof/workshop_12Jan_2023_data/cohortGraphs/taurus_10/annotation.relaxed.row_diff_int_brwt.annodbg

## 5.5 Make sure that configuration is correct

Run the following command
```
snakemake -np results/variants/annotated/cattle_taurus_10.cuteSV.ERR7091271.ont.minimap2/merged.vep.vcf.gz
```

This will print out all of the commands that snakemake would run to
generate that file, without actually running them. If there are any
configuration problems, you will find out here!

At this step you can run the entire workflow with one command
"snakemake -j 8". However, we are going to run each step individually
while explaining the workflow!

## 5.6 Workflow basics

* The commands to run the workflow consists of two parts: the "running mode", and an output files path.
* running mode can be either 
    * "-np" instructs snakemake to print the commands and parameters without running anything  
    * "-j 8" instructs snakemake to run the script using 8 threads
* output files files path follows the following pattern:

<img src="snakemake_path.png" alt="sv" width="700"/>


For example,
```
# print commands to map ERR5043144  using pbmm2
snakemake -np results/mapping/ERR5043144.hifi.pbmm2.bam 
  
# print commands to map ERR7091271 sample using minimap2
snakemake results/mapping/ERR7091271.ont.minimap2.bam -np
```

Let's start by mapping Nanopore reads in ERR7091271 using minimap2 and calculate statistics:
```
snakemake -j8 results/mapping/ERR7091271.ont.minimap2.alfred.txt
```
  
Note: Snakemake will automatically determine all the required
preceding steps in the workflow and execute them.  If you can't
follow at the workshop pace, just run the current command and
snakemake will catch up.


# 6) Workflow:

All the tutorial commands are written as Snakemake recipes. The
workflow (summarized in Figure 2) has the following steps:

  1. map using minimap2/pbmm2
  2. call small variants using clair3 and phase them using longshot
  3. split the reads into two haplotypes
  4. call SV using pbsv, sniffles, cuteSV
  5. merge the small and structural variants
  6. calculate AF using the great genotyper
  7. annotate the vcf using Variant effect predictor

![worflow_dag](dag.png)



# 7 Analysis of Oxford Nanopore reads (ERR7091271) 

## 7.1 Let's map the reads using minimap2
  
First, let's look at how the workflow is going to map the ONT reads
```
snakemake -np results/mapping/ERR7091271.ont.minimap2.alfred.txt
```

Let's check the quality of the mapping by looking at mapping statistics calculated by [alfredqc](https://www.gear-genomics.com/docs/alfred/).

```
cat results/mapping/ERR7091271.ont.minimap2.alfred.txt
``` 

Q: What is the median coverage?  and median read length?


## 7.2 Call and phase small variants using clair3 and longphase

The Clair3 step takes the bam file as input and it produces two vcf files: phased and unphased SNPs. It uses longshot to phase the small variants
Use the following command to run Clair3  
```
snakemake -p -j 8 results/clair3/ERR7091271.ont.minimap2.vcf.gz
```
@CTB note: revisit this section.
  
Let's check the number of detected variants

```
gzip -dc results/clair3/ERR7091271.ont.minimap2.vcf.gz |grep -vP "^#" |wc -l 
```
  
Let's compare the calling result with our gold standard. Notice here
that we added --use-conda to the command because this command needs
another conda environment:
```
snakemake -p -j 1 results/benchmarks_small/clair3.ERR7091271.ont.minimap2/result.summary.csv  --use-conda
cut -f1,11,12 -d, results/benchmarks_small/clair3.ERR7091271.ont.minimap2/result.summary.csv
```
@CTB note: --use-conda
  
##  7.3 call SVs

lets run cuteSV and sniffles for SV detection and benchmark the results.
```
snakemake -j 8 results/benchmarks/ERR7091271.txt
cat results/benchmarks/ERR7091271.txt
```

Our workflow supports SV calling using sniffles, and cuteSV. We are
going to try all of them and compare their performance. Only sniffles
can produce phased SV when running on haplotagged long reads. I
developed a hack for the other tools by splitting the bam files and
calling SVs on each haplotype independently. After that, phased SVs
are joined.

Q: Which tool produces the best performance? What is the effect of phasing? 



##  7.4 Calculate Population Allele Frequency

Here we are going to calculate population allele frequency for the
discovered structural and small variants by genotyping them in a
cohort of short-read samples. We are using our novel tool to do the
population genotyping efficiently. We created a database of the kmers
of 464 samples(aiming for 5000 samples). Our tool can utilize the
created databases to genotype phased SV and small variants.

Here we are going to use a tiny database of 10 samples.
```
snakemake -p -j 8 results/variants/GG/cattle_taurus_10.cuteSV.ERR7091271.ont.minimap2/merged.vcf.gz
```

let's take a peek at the result file:
```
gzip -dc results/variants/GG/cattle_taurus_10.cuteSV.ERR7091271.ont.minimap2/merged.vcf.gz  |grep -vP "^#" |head
```

or check the highly frequent variants:
```
bcftools view  -q 0.9 results/variants/GG/cattle_taurus_10.cuteSV.ERR7091271.ont.minimap2/merged.vcf.gz |grep -vP "^#" |head
```




# 8 Analysis of Pacbio hifi reads (ERR5043144) 

Here we are going to run a very similar workflow with a few adjustments:
1. pbmm2 is used instead of minimap2
2. clair3 is instructed to use another model for hifi reads
3. cuteSV is using different parameters
4. pbsv is added to the list of the SV callers

![hifi](hifi_dag.png)


Let's map and check the quality of the mapping
```
snakemake  -p -j 8 results/mapping/ERR5043144.hifi.pbmm2.alfred.txt
cat results/mapping/ERR5043144.ont.minimap2.alfred.txt
``` 

call small variants and run the benchmarking tool

```
snakemake -p -j 8 results/benchmarks_small/clair3.ERR5043144.hifi.minimap2/result.summary.csv  --use-conda
cut -f1,11,12 -d, results/benchmarks_small/clair3.ERR5043144.hifi.minimap2/result.summary.csv
```

call SV using all the tools and run the benchmarking tool

```
snakemake -j 8 results/benchmarks/ERR5043144.txt && cat results/benchmarks/ERR5043144.txt
```

```
